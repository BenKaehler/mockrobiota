human-readable-description	A mock community composed of 22 bacterial strains represented in equal abundances in two replicate samples, and the same strains represented in uneven abundances in two replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-4 and mock-5, which consists of the same mock community samples analyzed on separate Illumina sequencing runs. This was generated by Dr. Dirk Gevers at Broad Institute in 2012.
