#example-1
This directory contains example files that demonstrate the file format and directory structure required for all mockrobiota datasets. The one exception is [dataset-metadata.tsv](dataset-metadata.tsv), which exists for testing purposes and thus demonstrates the required format but does not serve as an example of typical content for a ``dataset-metadata.tsv`` file.

For data examples and templates, users are encouraged to follow the example of [other mockrobiota datasets](../).

For detailed formatting information and content descriptions, particularly for the required fields in ``dataset-metadata.tsv`` files, please see [instructions for contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

#Known issues / notes
This is only a test.
