human-readable-description	A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in mock-7 and mock-8, which consist of the same mock community samples analyzed on different Illumina sequencing runs. The mock community samples were generated by Dr. Peter Turnbaugh at Harvard in 2010, and sequenced by Illumina, Inc. in San Diego, CA, in 2010.
