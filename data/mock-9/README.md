#mock-9

A mock community composed of 16 fungal strains (12 species) represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in [mock-10](../mock-10/, which is the same mock community samples analyzed on a separate Illumina HiSeq run. This was generated by Dr. Benjamin Wolfe at Harvard University, in 2012.

#Known Issues / Notes

@mdeleeuw reports in [issue-27](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/mockrobiota/issues/27) that:
>the forward reads start 55bp upstream of the ITS sequences in Unite. As a consequence, forward reads fail closed reference picking and are underrepresented in taxonomic assignments for open reference and de novo picking.

This has not be independently verified, but we recommend that users trim forward and reverse primers (and outlying regions) from sequencing reads as a standard procedure for marker-gene sequencing data.
