#mock-10

A mock community composed of 16 fungal strains (12 species) represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in [mock-9](../mock-9/, which is the same mock community samples analyzed on a separate Illumina HiSeq run. This was generated by Dr. Benjamin Wolfe at Harvard University, in 2012.
